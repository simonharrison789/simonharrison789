## Professional Summary

An experienced technical writer and communicator with the ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously, meeting deadlines while improving quality and maintainability. I have earned a reputation for making the technical communications concerns of the business go away by providing HTML-based help, videos, API documentation, training materials, blogs, marketing copy, and UI text as appropriate.

I am a Fellow of the Institute of Technical Communicators (FISTC). References are available upon request.

## Professional Experience
### Principal Technical Writer, Ivanti (2017 – present)

Most recently I have been writing the documentation for a new cloud-native license management product and taken ownership of the documentation for a suite of patch management products.

- Used Madcap Flare to produce HTML5 help for both on-premise and cloud-native products.
- Worked in a team of five writers producing a single help output for the company’s flagship product suite that was published with a combination of quarterly and CI/CD releases.
- Member of the working group for the team’s style guide that is responsible for streamlining, optimising, and standardising both language use and css.
- Used Camtasia and Audacity to create YouTube videos to help customers to understand concepts and features in the product.
- Responsible for maintaining the localised versions of user documentation.
- Worked closely with developers to produce API documentation.
- Refactored legacy documentation projects to improve the separation of concerns in the XHTML source, removing the need for custom css and hard-coded styling.
- Cleaned the markup and tidied the project files of legacy projects to improve maintainability and ease of localisation. Localised versions of the help went from needing up to two hours each to publish updates to taking only five minutes each.
- Persuaded management that the product documentation needed to focus on being helpful rather than being exhaustive, and that painstakingly documenting the trivial not only added cost and maintenance issues, but also reduced the effectiveness of the documentation.

### Principal Technical Writer, Landesk (2008 – 2017)

When Touchpaper was acquired by Landesk, I became a Principal Technical Writer responsible for maintaining and developing all technical documentation for Landesk’s IT Service Management (ITSM) products.
- Used Madcap Flare to produce HTML5 web help for a range of IT Service Management products.
- Responsible for creating installation, design, administration, and end-user documentation for a large multi-tier, highly integrated ITSM solution.
- Worked closely with the in-house localisation team to ensure that both software and documentation was translated into a number of other languages.
- Used Alchemy Catalyst to create and maintain en-GB versions of software and documentation resources from the en-US source.
- Worked as a scrum master for two agile development teams.

### Documentation Manager, Touchpaper (2000 – 2008)
Following the demerger of Royalblue Technologies from the Royalblue Group to form Touchpaper, I became the Documentation Manager, responsible both for the staff management of a team of 4 technical writers, and for writing and guiding the direction of the company’s technical communications.
- Recruitment and staff management of a team of 4 technical writers.
- Led the migration of the documentation from PDFs using FrameMaker to CHM using Madcap Flare.
- Ensured timely delivery of all documentation deliverables for all the company’s products.
- Continued to write user and marketing documentation.
- Designed and produced materials for in-house trainers to use in customer training courses.
- Responsible for managing the localisation of software and documentation, using a third-party company.
- Drove the style guide and writing practices to facilitate and reduce the cost of localisation.
- Negotiated documentation priorities with senior management.

### Technical Writer, Royalblue Technologies (September 1995 – 2008)
Sole technical writer for an IT service management software product. Created PDFs covering installation, solution design, administration, and routine usage using Adobe FrameMaker and single-sourced CHM help files using WebWorks.
- Visited customers to interview them about their use of the products, writing case studies, newsletter articles, and other marketing materials.
- Ghost-wrote magazine articles for the Managing Director.
- Prepared PowerPoint presentations for the Engineering Manager to use in company meetings.

### Technical Author, Perkin Elmer (August 1990 – August 1995)
- Produced user guides, maintenance manuals, and tutorials for a range of infrared spectrometry and liquid chromatography hardware and software products. Deliverables were a mixture of paper manuals using Interleaf desktop publishing and compiled Windows help.
