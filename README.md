I am an experienced technical writer and communicator with the ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously, meeting deadlines while improving quality and maintainability. I have earned a reputation for making the technical communications concerns of the business go away by providing HTML-based help, videos, API documentation, training materials, blogs, marketing copy, and UI text as appropriate. I have a proven track record of providing technical communication that speeds customer on-boarding and return on investment, maximises customer satisfaction, and reduces support calls.
