# How to do proper Tech Comms
Good technical communication saves your organisation money, but too often there’s a tendency to settle for what’s the least we can do? Tech comms can be seen as a necessary evil, but what’s the point of developing exciting new software solutions if no one gets the best out of those solutions? Or if instead of users on-boarding themselves and teaching themselves from accessible, concise, and effective user documentation, your consultants or support executives are constantly teaching each new customer how to get started and how to use the software, and writing their own materials?

Much better to do it once, properly, than to push the cost down the line where it will grow with poorer, inconsistent results.

So what makes good user documentation? At its core, it is vital to remember the tech comms fundamentals: who are my audience and what do they know? And what are they trying to do and what do they need to know?

The user documentation is not the place for marketing materials – the target audience has already bought your product (although with a little care, it is possible to hit the tech comms fundamentals while also highlighting the possibility of up-selling). Nor is the user documentation an exhaustive technical specification (more on this later) – the user documentation is targeted at users with a question to answer and a job to do. The purpose of the user documentation is to get them back to that job as quickly as possible.

I have three things I like to keep in mind when trying to focus on my tech comms fundamentals:

-	Oh! I get it!
-	It’s not a thriller
-	Helpful, not exhaustive

## Oh! I get it!

The introduction is not a piece of marketing explaining how great the software is. The target audience has already bought it. The introduction is the place to get the user to say “Oh! I get it!”

This is where we give the big picture, covering:
- This is the problem you are trying to solve and how we go about resolving that problem
-	These are the components of the software and how they fit together
- This is how we use those components to get to the solution

Try to avoid getting into the details – maybe a few cross references with suggestions of what’s out there. At this point we want the user to get a feel for what’s possible and how it is achieved in broad brush strokes. Maybe a few illustrations. I find a video can help: different people learn in different ways, so having a 5-minute YouTube explaining the concepts can really help some, or a less formal blog can help others. The aim is to get users to understand the design concepts of the solution. Then they will be in a much better place to learn the details. Or maybe even just go off and play with the system and return to the help when they have a question.

## It’s not a thriller

When we get to the details, remember that you are not writing a page-turner thriller. We are not trying to keep our readers glued to the page. We are trying to get them back to work as quickly as possible.

This means we give away the answer right at the start of a section. *You can configure the default language for a group on the Administration page.*

For most users who have already “got it” this will be enough instruction. They have learned that they can configure different languages, and where to go to do so. The procedure that gives more detail follows this, for those who need more help.

## Helpful, not exhaustive

Finally, keep in mind that the documentation is supposed to be helpful, not exhaustive. At first that sounds wrong. Surely you need to cover everything in the documentation? I have had to explain why this is not the case to product managers who have forgotten that the purpose of documentation is not to describe everything, but to help users to get the best out of the solution and get back to their day job.
A bulleted list that describes the meanings of all possible statuses is not helpful. Access denied means that access was denied? Success means that the operation succeeded and Failure that it failed? Not only does this information patronise users, but it makes the document look unnecessarily large, adds to maintenance and localisation costs, and also makes the documentation less useful.
Consider the case where a user gets a failure message. They go to the online help and search for “failure” hoping to find a resolution or steps to analyse what could have caused the failure. The best search result is a single link to a page that gives this information. This is unlikely to happen, but the worst thing we can serve them is a page of results that all just tell them that “failure means it failed”.

## And finally,

Don’t short-change your customers, don’t waste the efforts of your product development team, and don’t over-burden your support staff. Rather, invest in quality user documentation that helps users to get the best out of the solution they have bought on their own.
